On November 23, 2004 and again on January 5, 2006 we identified problems in materials and workmanship that contributed to the failure of several "Pacific Fibre and Rope" products.
Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Painted splice tails red to indicate failure

Sprayed adhesive on whipping

7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.
Post time and number of sets to completion.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

5 Strict Pull-ups
7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.
Post time and number of sets to completion.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.
Get rid of your Pacific Fibre and Rope ladders, cargo nets, ropes, gangway nets, and other products.

On November 23, 2004 and again on January 5, 2006 we identified problems in materials and workmanship that contributed to the failure of several "Pacific Fibre and Rope" products.
Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Painted splice tails red to indicate failure

Sprayed adhesive on whipping

7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.
Post time and number of sets to completion.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Ten rounds for time of:
3 Weighted Pull-ups, 45 pounds
5 Strict Pull-ups
7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.
Post time and number of sets to completion.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.
Get rid of your Pacific Fibre and Rope ladders, cargo nets, ropes, gangway nets, and other products.

On November 23, 2004 and again on January 5, 2006 we identified problems in materials and workmanship that contributed to the failure of several "Pacific Fibre and Rope" products.
Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Painted splice tails red to indicate failure

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

On November 23, 2004 and again on January 5, 2006 we identified problems in materials and workmanship that contributed to the failure of several "Pacific Fibre and Rope" products.
Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Painted splice tails red to indicate failure

Sprayed adhesive on whipping

7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Ten rounds for time of:
3 Weighted Pull-ups, 45 pounds
5 Strict Pull-ups
7 Kipping Pull-up
For weighted pull-ups place a 45 pound dumbbell between the legs above crossed ankles and jettison the dumbbell after third rep and continue with strict pull-ups and then the kipping pull-ups. Coming off the bar or going to ground constitutes termination of a set.
Post time and number of sets to completion.

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.
Get rid of your Pacific Fibre and Rope ladders, cargo nets, ropes, gangway nets, and other products.

On November 23, 2004 and again on January 5, 2006 we identified problems in materials and workmanship that contributed to the failure of several "Pacific Fibre and Rope" products.
Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Painted splice tails red to indicate failure

Sprayed adhesive on whipping

We've had ropes and cargo nets fail at multiple CrossFit locations and the problem is endemic to Pacific Fibre and Rope's rigging. Rigging experts from West Marine, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have examined these products and been appalled at the substandard materials and workmanship.
On first announcing the defects (http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000613.html) we removed our link to Pacific Fibre and Rope, but unfortunately after rebuilding a crash of the CrossFit site the link reappeared because it had not been removed from backup files.

On November 23, 2004 and again on January 5, 2006 we identified problems in materials and workmanship that contributed to the failure of several "Pacific Fibre and Rope" products.
Respectful of this 78-year-old family owned and run company, we negotiated and encouraged a fix of the problems that included a promise to report the remedy. Here it is:
Triangle ring, 6,000 pound rating

Carabineer, 10,000 pound rating

Splice "whipped" with nylon cord

Painted splice tails red to indicate failure

Sprayed adhesive on whipping

The trace in the photo on the left shows the vertical rise of the ?first pull? followed by the horizontal travel of the ?scoop? bringing the torso to perpendicular before the super-explosive vertical launch of the hip and bar during the ?second pull?. The development of this skill is unique in its development of speed strength.
Contrast this with the horizontal hip thrust in the photo on the right characteristic of the dumbbell swing and kettlebell exercises (swing, snatch, and clean). This relatively low powered line of action, though adequate for developing aerobic and anaerobic strength endurance, will not develop athletic explosiveness though fans of the kettlebell claim otherwise.

Fusing The Pit and CrossFit, legendary fight trainer John Hackleman has given birth to a uniquely effective strategy for MMA fight training called "CrossPit". This fusion has already been adopted, and successfully tested by some of the world's best known MMA/UFC fighters and scores of amateurs. On the weekend of March 25-26 the first CrossPit Seminar will be held at CrossFit Santa Cruz. Grapplers will learn how to avoid being knocked out, and strikers will learn how to avoid the takedown.
Avoidance, fear, and even banning, of the clean and jerk is rooted in confusion and misunderstanding over the essentialness of its application and perfect functionality. [video]

Whether push-pressing or jerking, the dip and drive should keep the torso perpendicular to the ground. The explosive potential of the perpendicular torso is a recurring theme (study 060107 and 060120) and crucial to big cleans, snatches, jerks, push-press, vertical leap, and throw for height. None of these movements is the result of a hip thrust. Developing the push-press, then the push-jerk, and finally hang cleans and snatches without the chest coming forward at all provides essential training and practice for developing maximal explosive power.

Bad descent, left. Good descent, right.
It is a weak squat that descends solely with an eccentric contraction of the hip and leg extensors. Ideally, the hip and leg extensors should be engaged in a powerful isometric contraction which the hip flexors overcome with a concentric contraction that pulls the squat downward. Engaging the hip flexors in this manner sets up a stabilizing tug-of-war for the pelvis between the hip flexors and extensors, creates an anterior tilt of the pelvis that supports the isometric contraction of the erector spinae, allows for a deeper squat without surrendering the lumbar curve, and additionally stretches the hamstrings for a more powerful return from the bottom.

Whether push-pressing or jerking, the dip and drive should keep the torso perpendicular to the ground. The explosive potential of the perpendicular torso is a recurring theme (study 060107 and 060120) and crucial to big cleans, snatches, jerks, push-press, vertical leap, and throw for height. None of these movements is the result of a hip thrust. Developing the push-press, then the push-jerk, and finally hang cleans and snatches without the chest coming forward at all provides essential training and practice for developing maximal explosive power.

Bad descent, left. Good descent, right.
It is a weak squat that descends solely with an eccentric contraction of the hip and leg extensors. Ideally, the hip and leg extensors should be engaged in a powerful isometric contraction which the hip flexors overcome with a concentric contraction that pulls the squat downward. Engaging the hip flexors in this manner sets up a stabilizing tug-of-war for the pelvis between the hip flexors and extensors, creates an anterior tilt of the pelvis that supports the isometric contraction of the erector spinae, allows for a deeper squat without surrendering the lumbar curve, and additionally stretches the hamstrings for a more powerful return from the bottom.

Whether push-pressing or jerking, the dip and drive should keep the torso perpendicular to the ground. The explosive potential of the perpendicular torso is a recurring theme (study 060107 and 060120) and crucial to big cleans, snatches, jerks, push-press, vertical leap, and throw for height. None of these movements is the result of a hip thrust. Developing the push-press, then the push-jerk, and finally hang cleans and snatches without the chest coming forward at all provides essential training and practice for developing maximal explosive power.

Fusing The Pit and CrossFit, legendary fight trainer John Hackleman has given birth to a uniquely effective strategy for MMA fight training called "CrossPit". This fusion has already been adopted, and successfully tested by some of the world's best known MMA/UFC fighters and scores of amateurs. On the weekend of March 25-26 the first CrossPit Seminar will be held at CrossFit Santa Cruz. Grapplers will learn how to avoid being knocked out, and strikers will learn how to avoid the takedown.

The angle of the torso determines the flight trajectory of the athlete. In the first photo Annie's trajectory will be upward as in a vertical jump or clean. In the second photo she is going to go up and forward as in a box jump. Finally, in the third photo, she'll move forward as she would for a broad jump.

Bad descent, left. Good descent, right.
It is a weak squat that descends solely with an eccentric contraction of the hip and leg extensors. Ideally, the hip and leg extensors should be engaged in a powerful isometric contraction which the hip flexors overcome with a concentric contraction that pulls the squat downward. Engaging the hip flexors in this manner sets up a stabilizing tug-of-war for the pelvis between the hip flexors and extensors, creates an anterior tilt of the pelvis that supports the isometric contraction of the erector spinae, allows for a deeper squat without surrendering the lumbar curve, and additionally stretches the hamstrings for a more powerful return from the bottom.

Bad descent, left. Good descent, right.
It is a weak squat that descends solely with an eccentric contraction of the hip and leg extensors. Ideally, the hip and leg extensors should be engaged in a powerful isometric contraction which the hip flexors overcome with a concentric contraction that pulls the squat downward. Engaging the hip flexors in this manner sets up a stabilizing tug-of-war for the pelvis between the hip flexors and extensors, creates an anterior tilt of the pelvis that supports the isometric contraction of the erector spinae, allows for a deeper squat without surrendering the lumbar curve, and additionally stretches the hamstrings for a more powerful return from the bottom.

The angle of the torso determines the flight trajectory of the athlete. In the first photo Annie's trajectory will be upward as in a vertical jump or clean. In the second photo she is going to go up and forward as in a box jump. Finally, in the third photo, she'll move forward as she would for a broad jump.

Whether push-pressing or jerking, the dip and drive should keep the torso perpendicular to the ground. The explosive potential of the perpendicular torso is a recurring theme (study 060107 and 060120) and crucial to big cleans, snatches, jerks, push-press, vertical leap, and throw for height. None of these movements is the result of a hip thrust. Developing the push-press, then the push-jerk, and finally hang cleans and snatches without the chest coming forward at all provides essential training and practice for developing maximal explosive power.

The angle of the torso determines the flight trajectory of the athlete. In the first photo Annie's trajectory will be upward as in a vertical jump or clean. In the second photo she is going to go up and forward as in a box jump. Finally, in the third photo, she'll move forward as she would for a broad jump.
"Cum Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc" (With this, therefore because of this)
Assuming causation on the basis of correlation is a logical fallacy that marks much of bad science and politics.
Here are a handful of links, some entertaining, some informative on the "Cum Hoc" fallacy:
"Correlation Implies Causation (Logical Fallacy)", Wikipedia
"Correlation or Causation?" Jonathan Mueller
"New Poll Shows Correlation is Causation", Happy Hour Archive
"Correlation and Causation", Peter Federer
